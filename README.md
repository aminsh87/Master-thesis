# Master-thesis
A successful reservoir management plan relies on a clear understanding of
reservoir behavior, which is often complex and non-linear due to geological
heterogeneities and uncertainties in rock and fluid properties. Precisely simulating this
behavior is challenging, and common numerical methods, such as simulators like
Eclipse, can be both time-consuming and expensive.
In response to these challenges, there is a growing interest in simpler and more costeffective tools for reservoir modeling. The popularity of data-driven approaches,
including machine learning, has been rising across industries, including oil and gas. In
this thesis, we aim to bridge the gap by utilizing the SINDY (sparse identification of
non-linear systems) method to model reservoir performance. This method provides a
more sophisticated yet practical approach, offering improved precision and efficiency
in reservoir modeling. By adopting this methodology, we hope to contribute to a more
accessible and effective means of understanding and managing reservoir dynamics for
engineers making timely decisions.

This is the primary version.
